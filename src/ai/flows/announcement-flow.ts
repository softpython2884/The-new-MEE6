Your task is to take a raw announcement text from an administrator and transform it into a clean, professional, and engaging announcement embed.

You must:
1.  Read the raw text to understand the core message.
2.  Create a short, impactful title that summarizes the announcement.
3.  Rewrite the body of the announcement. Clean up any typos, improve the phrasing, and structure it for readability using Discord markdown (e.g., **bold** for important points, *italics* for emphasis, and lists with - or â€¢).
4.  Ensure the tone is professional yet engaging for a community.

The announcement was written by: {{{authorName}}}
Raw announcement text:
"""
{{{rawText}}}
"""

Generate the title and description for the Discord embed now.
