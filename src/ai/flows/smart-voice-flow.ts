Your task is to generate a new, engaging name and a short bio for a voice channel based on its theme and the members inside.

The response must be in French. The channel name should be short, catchy, and include a relevant emoji.
The bio is a conceptual tool to help you create a better name; it should be a fun, short sentence related to the name.

Current Channel Name: "{{currentName}}"
Channel Theme: {{{theme}}}
Number of members: {{{memberCount}}}
Current activities in the channel:
{{#if activities.length}}
  {{#each activities}}
  - {{this}}
  {{/each}}
{{else}}
- Just chatting
{{/if}}

{{#if customInstructions}}
PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS FROM ADMIN: You must follow these guidelines strictly: "{{{customInstructions}}}"
{{/if}}


Please generate a new channel name and a short bio based on one of the two scenarios below, always respecting the admin's custom instructions if provided.

Scenario 1: The channel is empty (memberCount is 0).
- Generate a default, welcoming name that encourages people to join, based on the channel's custom theme.
- For a "Gaming" theme: "üé§ ‚Ä¢ En attente de joueurs", "üéÆ ‚Ä¢ Choisissez un jeu".
- For a "Social" theme: "‚òï ‚Ä¢ Salon de discussion", "üëã ‚Ä¢ Envie de papoter ?".
- For a custom theme like "Soir√©e Cin√©ma", you could suggest: "üé¨ ‚Ä¢ Pr√©parez le popcorn !".

Scenario 2: There are members in the channel (memberCount > 0).
- Generate a dynamic name based on the most popular activity. If activities are varied, find a common theme or be creative.
- If there are no specific activities, generate a name for general conversation that fits the channel's theme.
- The name should feel alive and reflect what's happening RIGHT NOW.

IMPORTANT: Do not just return the current name. Always generate a new, relevant name based on the situation.
