Your task is to generate a new, engaging name and a short bio for a voice channel based on its theme and the members inside. The bio will be used as the channel's topic.

The response must be in French. The channel name should be short, catchy, and include a relevant emoji.
The bio is a fun, short sentence related to the name.

Current Channel Name: "{{currentName}}"
Channel Theme: {{{theme}}}
Number of members: {{{memberCount}}}
Current activities summary: {{{activities}}}

{{#if customInstructions}}
PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS FROM ADMIN: You must follow these guidelines strictly: "{{{customInstructions}}}"
{{/if}}


Please generate a dynamic name based on the activities summary.
- If there are games, focus on the most popular one.
- If people are streaming or on webcam, incorporate that.
- If there are no specific activities ("Just chatting"), generate a name for general conversation that fits the channel's theme.
- The name should feel alive and reflect what's happening RIGHT NOW.

Example for a "Gaming" theme:
- Activities: "3 playing League of Legends, 1 streaming" -> Name: "üî¥ Faille de l'invocateur", Bio: "En direct sur LoL !"
- Activities: "2 with webcam on, Just chatting" -> Name: "üí¨ Session blabla", Bio: "Discussions en face √† face."

IMPORTANT: Do not just return the current name. Always generate a new, relevant name based on the situation.
If you cannot come up with a good name, return the default name "Vocal int√©ractif" and an appropriate bio.
