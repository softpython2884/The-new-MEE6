Your task is to generate a new, engaging name and a short bio for a voice channel based on its theme and the members inside. The bio will be used as the channel's topic.

The response must be in French. The channel name should be short, catchy, and include a relevant emoji.
The bio is a fun, short sentence related to the name.

Current Channel Name: "{{currentName}}"
Channel Theme: {{{theme}}}
Number of members: {{{memberCount}}}
Current activities in the channel:
{{#if activities.length}}
  {{#each activities}}
  - {{this}}
  {{/each}}
{{else}}
- Just chatting
{{/if}}

{{#if customInstructions}}
PRIORITY INSTRUCTIONS FROM ADMIN: You must follow these guidelines strictly: "{{{customInstructions}}}"
{{/if}}


Please generate a dynamic name based on the activities.
- If there are games, focus on the most popular one.
- If people are streaming or on webcam, incorporate that.
- If there are no specific activities, generate a name for general conversation that fits the channel's theme.
- The name should feel alive and reflect what's happening RIGHT NOW.

Example for a "Gaming" theme:
- Activities: "Streaming", "League of Legends" -> Name: "üî¥ Stream de LoL", Bio: "En direct sur la Faille de l'Invocateur."
- Activities: "Webcam on", "Just chatting" -> Name: "üí¨ Session blabla", Bio: "Discussions en face √† face."

IMPORTANT: Do not just return the current name. Always generate a new, relevant name based on the situation.
If the member count is 0, the AI flow should suggest "Vocal int√©ractif". This logic is also handled outside this prompt, but your response should be consistent with it.
If you cannot come up with a good name, return the default name "Vocal int√©ractif" and an appropriate bio.
