# **App Name**: Discord Panel Revamp

## Core Features:

- Simplified Login: Implement a landing page where users enter their Discord ID to initiate the panel access, bypassing the OAuth2 flow for a simpler initial setup.
- Server Selection: Display the list of servers the user has administrative permissions for.
- Dashboard Navigation: Create a sidebar navigation similar to the DraftBot panel, allowing users to easily switch between different server configurations.
- Moderation Configuration: Enable configuration of moderation settings, allowing admins to customize aspects like sanction messages and moderator anonymity.
- Module Management: Display modules like welcome messages, auto-moderation, and reaction roles, each with configurable options.
- Sanction Presets: Provide the ability to define preset sanctions that moderators can apply, streamlining the moderation process.
- AI-Powered Configuration Suggestions: Utilize a generative AI model to suggest appropriate configurations for moderation and other features based on server activity and community size; the AI tool will decide if its output should contain elements of established 'best practices' for server configuration.
- Custom Commands: Allow server admins to create custom commands that the bot will execute when triggered.
- DraftBot-Like Dashboard Layout: The dashboard should resemble the DraftBot layout, with server icons on the far left, module configurations in the second navigation bar, and the main content area to the right.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark slate blue (#2c3e50) to establish a professional and calming environment. The bot and its configurations should feel stable.
- Background color: Dark gray (#34495e) provides sufficient contrast for readability in a dark theme while complementing the primary color.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00bcd4) draws attention to important interactive elements. The hue complements the blueish main color.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, is versatile and well-suited to both headlines and body text due to its modern, neutral appearance.
- Use clear, outlined icons from 'lucide-react' to represent different modules and actions within the panel.
- Adopt a three-column layout, as seen in DraftBot, with a server sidebar, navigation sidebar, and main content area for efficient use of screen space.
- Employ subtle transition animations to indicate state changes, such as expanding accordions and loading content.
